# The digital wallet gold standard of the future.

Mogo was founded in 2003 by David & Gregory Feller in Vancouver. The idea came about when the twin brothers were discussing how hard it was to get a loan as a consumer. 
They identified the pain point which is the long procedure and multiple visits to the financial institution. With everything being done more and more on the internet, 
they figured they can digitally transform the process to benefit the consumers by providing quicker, better, and easier to use service. They found a way to remove all 
the friction from the process using technology. Mogo was first funded by equity and debt financings totaling more than $380 million. That Includes 2 rounds of private 
equity financings and securing two credit facilities with a large financial institution. (*1) The company IPO'd on the TSX on June 25th 2015 and shares traded for $10 
per share. It was then listed on the NASDAQ on April 1th, 2018(*2). Considered a giant in the industry, the company has been making a couple strategic acquisitions to 
grow its user base and to offer Mogomembers more services. Fortification Capital, Moka, Carta Worldwide & Difference Capital are amongst those acquired (*19). There has 
also been mergers such as with Coinsquare (*19). All these companies are investment dealers, competitors or are in the digital transformation. These companies will 
provide Mogo with the tools to build out its Wealth & savings pillar. This ability to offer clients better wealth solutions will translate into higher retention rates 
as seen with previous new product offerings.

The company's target demographic is the digital native millennials. Mogo provides a collective of financial and even educational services. The ecosystem created is one 
that encompasses credit score monitoring, identity fraud protection, prepaid Debit card services through Visa, personal loans, Bitcoin trading & Mortgages. The business 
aims to build a financial services brand that millennials identify with regarding all aspects of personal finance. A digital millennial bank of sorts. Being one of the 
oldest in the fintech space, Mogo delivers a service that is easier and fast to use all while looking elegant. The idea of a tech savvy bank resonates 
with younger individuals. (*3) Millennials are now the largest generation of Canadians (*4) (27% of the total population). Despite being the most educated generation so 
far, this group is having the hardest time building wealth when compared to previous generations(*4). How equipped are parents to teach their children about sound money 
management when families reach a record debt level? (*4) What about those most vulnerable, such as the bottom fifty percent? in what way can they be empowered to better 
their lives and the lives of everyone around them? Canadian households owe a dollar seventy three on average for every dollar they make (*5). It is very clear how this 
can quickly get out of hand and change people's lives and not for the better. Payday loans for example prey on poor desperate customers by only offering obscene interest rates(*6). They understand their customer base is not financially savvy or even litarite and as a consequence understand that these customers have no where else to turn. Such bad products have been scrutinized by governments and journalists alike, yet they still exist today (*6). Those at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale are the most prayed on by such financial institutions. Overdraft fees at the big banks is a great source of revenue and it comes straight out of the pockets of those who need it the most (*7) But what about the slightly more savvy person? The person who has more options and a better credit score, are they really at that much of an advantage than those at the bottom? The evidence does not seem to suggest that. Other than access to payday loans and being subject to overdraft fees, those with 
slightly better credit scores (usually young people getting a foothold in the job market) are a target demographic for credit card marketers (*8). It is not uncommon to 
see a credit card sign up war on university campuses, they target the freshmen publicly (*8). Many studies show that business always prefer to obtain their customers at 
a younger age in order to establish trust and brand loyalty (*8). Even those actively obtaining high paying skills are bombarded with too much easy credit at around 
twenty percent interest. Mogo wants to fix that. 

Mogo has truly taken the gamification of investing and translated it into personal finance in general. "Gamifying saving the planet and stacking money" (*19). Through 
tech and design, Platforms are now more engaging to their users and can even result in the user producing dopamine which increases the users time on app(*13). Customers 
would certainly use such a new tool to signal social status. Even if we both used an application to get approved for a service, Mogo would still have a more elegant 
looking service that is much quicker. Days quicker than a commercial big bank in fact (*9). The versatility in other avenues too sets them apart from the legacy 
competitors. Access to bitcoin is yet to be offered at the banks. The Payday loans available are at a much lower interest than a cash advance business. Mogo also does 
a great job of making many financial products frictionless for their users while providing informative education on these products with clear terms and conditions. The 
reason for why and how these products are used, helps the users feel more empowered to make the right choice, coupled with a 30 day money back guarantee on loans that 
the client does not want to see all the way through (*9). The four pillars that house the products and services of the platform are Monitor and protect, control your 
spending, borrow responsibly, and save and invest wisely. Notice the naming of these categories as they are important for the grand scheme of what mogo is doing. The 
clear designation of each makes the user comfortable, almost looked out for too. Borrow responsibly, or their lending segment of the business was the launching point 
for the digital wallet. Although basic, the use case was very simple and straightforward. Mogo can provide Payday loans at a much cheaper price than the competition 
(who price gauge) because of the saved costs thanks to automation and having no physical store locations with employees to pay for. Mortgages are also available and 
through the same business model are passing down the savings to the client.  Monitor and protect is credit score monitoring and ID fraud protection. The tools needed to 
measure and protect finances, which are provided for free to the users as a starting point on their financial journey. These add on services are free at first to entice 
people to download the app. As of November 2021 there are currently 1.8 million users (*10) and web traffic of 395,485 monthly visits (*19). As of recent these services 
are only available to Mogo card holders. Using a sort of freemium model, these services are used as a funnel into bigger paid products. Control your spending is the 
category that houses a prepaid visa debit card service. While not as convenient as a regular debit card, using this service Mogo is emphasizing to its Mogo Members the 
importance of only spending your own money. This approach is the complete opposite of what the big banks hope for in a client. The more their credit cards are used the 
more money the bank makes. The company also decided to implement creative incentives for clients to use and like their cards. Other than the services provided in the 
first pillar (free of charge) Mogo is actively planting a tree for every swipe or tap of the Mogocard.(*10). This is a great marketing tool that is provides an enhanced 
brand of social responsibility. Save and invest wisely is probably where the most exciting advancements are. As of now, The carbon footprint offset program available to 
Mogo Members is used to provide a better than market product. With the already existing tree plant per swipe program, clients can use it to guarantee that whatever 
bitcoin they buy from the platform is green. This is undeniably attractive to the younger demographic (*11).  MogoWealth is currently still under development and is the 
second half of the last pillar. The company is acquiring other parallel financial companies to incorporate into its stack of products like Moka and Canadian Investment 
Dealer Fortification Capital Inc in order to bring more offerings to its platform such as commision free trading. (*12) As a digital wallet platform versatility is as 
important as ease of use and cost, no other platform can deliver like Mogo such bragging rights. 

The introduction of digital assets is also a major trend that the company has been capitalizing on heavily. Primed to enter this space before any of its traditional 
competitors, Mogo announced the Bitcoin integration in 2017 which was relatively early to market for a non crypto business. In fact, none of the big banks or online banks has offered this yet. But who are Mogo's competitors? Online banks lack behind in rates & ease of use or even registration. Mogo might not have a checkings or savings accounts but they do have their own saving and spending methods that speak more to the consumer than just traditional finance finally arriving on your phone such as Tangerine by ScotiaBank. The usage of online banking skyrocketed over the last two years due to the pandemic (*14). Credit score monitoring companies are not really competition since they don't offer near enough services and products to be a digital wallet competitor. Manulife Bank is another legacy financial institution trying to get a foothold in this side of the financial space, but just like Tangerine it's simply old tricks going digital. There are other fintech corporations that are better competitors with MOGO. Only KOHO from what I can see comes as a close second in Canada. They operate on the same model, Prepaid debit cards but instead of offering bitcoin they provide a savings account with CDIC (*15). By moving into the US market, competition is certainly increasing (*16). Credit Karma is a large competitor that is pivoting from only credit monitoring to providing personal loans and mortgages too, yet far behind (*17). Paypal is currently their biggest competition south of the border. New players such as Blockfi or SoFi are serious competitors as well doing things a little differently but if they can overcome their own set backs they would certainly be a threat. All competitors seem to be focused on one specific feature to set them aside from the competition, those that are trying to lead the market at least. There doesn't seem to be a do it all one stop shop on the market but we do seem to be moving closer to it with time. It appears that that is the aim of the Feller twins. Applications used to build the application include the javaScript library jQuery, a free open source web server called NGINX & an in-memory database called Redis.Ruby is the open source programming language used along with  Go. A open source multi protocol messaging broker called RabbitMQ and as for the front-end framework an application called Foundation was chosen. Other business tools include google analytics, Asana & Pivotal Tracker. Github,docker, New relic, Kibana, CircleCI, HAProxy, Code CLimate & Airbrake were used (*19)       


There are many ways to offer more to the current and future client base as it currently stands. As a customer and shareholder, I would like to see Mogo offer more of 
what they do best, providing their customers with better solutions that also educate the client on what the best outcome can be if certain steps are taken. In the Future Mogo members should not only expect to trade with zero fees attached, but rather have more options at the same low price for example. Different and new trade pairings can help differentiate them further on their new wealth venture. Trading Bitcoin for Tesla stocks for example, or vise versa, could be interesting for example. My suggestion however would be to dive deeper into wealth planning. With a large transfer of wealth from the baby boomer generation to the next approaching, Mogo would 
benefit greatly in my opinion if their target demographic who is about to inherit more wealth go to them for their financial solutions. Insurance would a great 
opportunity to apply the same winning formula in another integration. Just as they have done in the mortgage and payday loan products, Mogo could provide competitive 
products in these areas by implementing the same model. Life insurance is not a product usually taylord for the young, yet buying a policy at a younger age could result 
in much lower premiums in the long run. (*20) What if Mogo projected these savings through an educational segment and marketing? The insurance industry is one that has not 
been disturbed in my lifetime. The same players are still in the market. Technological innovation in the field stops for the most part at the Vitality product (*18). 
As a millennial I often wonder how technology will make its way into the insurance industry. There is more than one way for it to be beneficial. insurance policies 
denominated in bitcoin could be one. Holding an asset that continues to appreciate over the long term is in my opinion a perfect pairing. Another way for tech to improve on the current space would be to provide policy price comparison between all the available 
carrier. that way the applicant does not need to apply with every insurance company one at a time, but can rather see all the prices from all providers in one neat 
window and take the appropriate action. This will further improve on the holistic approach the company is trying to provide to the clients. This process will provide a 
much more streamlined experience where the client is not only better informed about the differences in products, but also happy with the digital transformation of this 
service that would not require them to connect with an advisor at all. The process would also have a much faster approval and issuance rate that would certainly interest the client & improve client retention since the product is a long term one.  It has to start with small policies face values to offer but as the Wealth segment grows, the company could offer bigger more complex products. No new tools would be needed for this recommendation, only new data sets and code modification.
